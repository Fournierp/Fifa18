## Fifa

Using the [dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset)
I did a data analysis looking at the correlation between the characteristics of a player and its value on the transfer market and its salary.
Then I did a model to predict its value and wage based on the analysed characteristics.
